## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Study with the Materials
1. Read `MASTERY-GUIDE.md` for key concepts
2. Review `decision-charts/DECISION-FLOWCHARTS.md` for visual decision trees
3. Use `parsed_questions.json` with the RAG chatbot

### Option 2: Build the RAG Training Chatbot
Follow the step-by-step guide in `BUILD-GUIDE.md` to create your own AI-powered study assistant using:
- Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases
- Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
- Claude 3 (or your preferred model)

## 🔑 Key Decision Patterns

### When to Use What (Quick Reference)

**Latency Requirements:**
- `< 100ms` → Real-time endpoint + Priority tier
- `< 500ms` → Standard tier or Provisioned Throughput
- `Seconds OK` → Flex tier or Serverless
- `No SLA` → Batch inference (50% cost savings)

**PII Handling:**
- Need to recover PII later → ANONYMIZE + Tokenization
- Block entirely → BLOCK mode
- Never: Post-process with Comprehend (PII already logged!)

**Vector Store Selection:**
- 100M+ docs, monthly updates → S3 Vectors (90% cheaper)
- Auto-scaling needed → OpenSearch Serverless
- Sub-ms latency → ElastiCache
- Need ACID/SQL → Aurora PostgreSQL + pgvector

**Cost Optimization:**
- Repeated prompts → Prompt caching (90% discount)
- Batch workloads → Batch inference (50% off)
- Large vectors → Titan 256-dim (75% less storage)

## 🛠️ Building the RAG Chatbot

The chatbot uses these AWS services (all covered on the exam!):

| Service                   | Purpose             | Exam Domain   |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Bedrock Knowledge Base    | RAG retrieval       | Domain 1      |
| Bedrock Guardrails        | Content safety      | Domain 3      |
| S3                        | Document storage    | Domain 1      |
| CloudWatch                | Monitoring          | Domain 4      |
| Claude 3 / Titan          | LLM inference       | Domain 2      |

See `BUILD-GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.

## 📈 Top Services to Know

From analyzing 900 questions, these services appear most frequently:

1. **Amazon Bedrock** - 376 questions (42%)
2. **AWS Lambda** - 162 questions (18%)
3. **Amazon CloudWatch** - 126 questions (14%)
4. **Amazon EventBridge** - 63 questions (7%)
5. **Amazon S3** - 50 questions (6%)

## ⚠️ Common Anti-Patterns

Things the exam tests you on NOT doing:

| Scenario                  | Wrong Choice                  | Why                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| GPU inference             | Lambda                        | Lambda doesn't support GPU                            |
| PII protection            | Comprehend post-process       | PII already logged before detection                   |
| Async agent pattern       | Step Functions                | Agents can't integrate with Step Functions directly   |
| Embedding model change    | Keep old vectors              | Must re-index when embedding model changes            |
| Variable traffic          | Fixed provisioned capacity    | Use auto-scaling or scale-to-zero                     |
